SettingsMagic
=============

It's a little plugin written for a weird project where I came to after some years of development.
It assumes that you have a AR class Setting where all your settings come from and that classes have methods which return an array of fields, for which these classes needs settings for.


Example
=======

In your Setting class:

settings_for "Article", :custom_fields

generates:

def self.articles_custom_fields
  result = []
  Article.custom_fields.each do |f|
    result << Setting.find_or_create_by_name({ :name => "article_"+f, :wert => f.humanize })
  end
  result
end
